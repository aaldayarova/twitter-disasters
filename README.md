Built two unsupervised learning models (bag of words and n-grams models) using two different algorithms (bernoulli naive bayes and logistic regression). Used F1 scores to identify that bag of words model using logistic regression performed the best on this dataset. The goal of the models was to use natural language processing to identify whether given tweets represented tweets pertaining to disasters.
